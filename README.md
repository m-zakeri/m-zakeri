## Welcome
I enjoy domain-independent problem-solving from **Computer Science (CS)** perspective.
I like devising new thinking paradigms, problem-solving methods, and systems for complexity engineering. 
Complex real-life problems could be simplified and solved through various thinking paradigms: systematic thinking, abstract thinking, computational thinking, data thinking, network thinking, and eventually, what I call reverse computational thinking.
